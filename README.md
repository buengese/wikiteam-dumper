# WikiTeam - dumpgenerator

Hard fork of wikiteam/dumpgenerator.py MediaWiki dumping script taken from [WikiTeam/wikiteam](https://github.com/WikiTeam/wikiteam/). Ported to Python 3 because of internal needs. Also contains a number of fixes. Will probably never be upstreamed because Python 3 ports pr's have been actively ignored for years. Might be superseded by a proper rewrite by the original authors at some point.
